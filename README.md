# Vulkan/DX12 RHI & Renderer

A backend-agnostic rendering hardware interface with Vulkan and DirectX 12 implementations. This project is mostly serving as a base layer for any future GPU driven projects of mine in the future. I will be using some modern features of each graphics API, but the current Vulkan architecture is mostly 1.2 with some extensions standardized in 1.3. The example projects are mostly using compute and graphic techniques popularized 5-10 years ago.

## Features and Architecture

### Rendering Hardware Interface (WIP)
- Dual backend support: Vulkan and DirectX 12, selectable at compile time
- Support for GPU-driven indirect rendering pipeline with compute-based decision making support
- Double-buffered command update system for low-latency CPU/GPU synchronization
- Custom linear allocator stack with per-frame or static allocation tiers
- Backend-agnostic resource descriptions translated to native API barriers in the hot loop
- Enhanced Barriers (DX12) and explicit pipeline barriers (Vulkan) for correct synchronization
- Typed handle pool with runtime validation for all driver/COM objects
- Data driven layouts for shader resource usage, attachment graphs and generic pipeline states
- Bring your own shader mentality, define your own layouts and no preconceived notions of how data will be submitted to the GPU and used by your shaders.

### Backend Abstraction
Resource descriptions are expressed in a backend-agnostic layer. Barrier semantics, pipeline states, and shader resource layouts are described once and translated to native API calls at submission time. Resource management is handled automatically during runtime and optimized to reduce command recording and driver command processing while retaining high accuracy. 

### Render Graph
Attachment graphs express render pass dependencies and resource lifetimes. Pipeline state objects and shader resource layouts are declared separately from draw submission, allowing the renderer to manage resource transitions automatically.

### Current Status

| System | Status |
|---|---|
| Vulkan backend | Working |
| DX12 backend | In progress |
| Backend unification | In progress |
| Windows platform code | Working |
| Linux platform code | In progress |

## Examples

### SMBReader
This project is an editor for SMB archives used to store data for the game Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. Right now, it supports loading character mesh, texture and animation data and not much else. Most of my time has been spent building the compute shader system that manages the rendering of these and other type of meshes (along with building the RHI). Still a WIP, but here are the features:

#### GPU Culling & Scene Management
- Compute shader frustum culling 
- Atomic compaction of draw commands into indirect draw buffers
- Uniform grid spatial partitioning for per-mesh light assignment
- Per-mesh point light, spot light, and directional light culling in a single compute pass

#### Vertex Pipeline
- Programmable vertex pulling via raw byte buffer with no fixed vertex layout
- Runtime vertex format decoding supporting multiple vertex format variations without PSO explosion
- Use vertex compression formats fully reversed and implemented from OddWorld:
  - 6-byte quantized positions (AABB-relative fixed point, signed 16-bit per axis)
  - 10-10-10-2 packed normals
  - 10-10-10-1 packed tangents with handedness bit
  - Fixed point UV coordinates (signed 16-bit with quantization scale)
  - 8-bit per channel vertex colors
- Separate compressed and uncompressed decode paths with shared decompressor functions

#### Shadow Mapping
- Atlas-based shadow mapping with viewport transform baked into vertex shader
- Per-mesh shadow map assignment via renderable index indirection
- NDC-to-atlas tile transform for multi-light shadow atlases

#### Asset Pipeline
- SMB archive parsing for Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD and original Xbox
- GR2 (Granny) skeleton data extraction 
- Generic vertex description system with compression metadata
- AABB and bounding sphere per mesh for culling

#### Technical Notes

**Why programmable vertex pulling over fixed layouts?**
The Oddworld data contains 125+ distinct vertex format variants. PSO permutation per format is not feasible. Runtime branching on a uniform `vertexComponents` flag per draw call avoids warp divergence within a draw while handling the full format space.

**Why atlas shadow maps?**
Packing multiple shadow maps into a single atlas reduces descriptor overhead and allows shadow map assignment to be resolved during the GPU culling pass rather than requiring a separate CPU-side pass.

**Vertex compression formats** were reversed from the SMB binary data using Ghidra and cross-referenced against released PDBs.
